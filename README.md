# MowIt
Move It is an idle puzzle game. In this game the player must find the right way to mow the lawns of each house. He earns money by mowing the lawns at home. He must improve his lawn mower in the market with the money he earns, because as the level of the houses increases, it becomes more difficult to mow the lawn and find the right path. The time each grass was cut is stored as data, and when the player re-enters the game, the grass grows again according to the elapsed time. Grass needs to be cut again every time it grows.
